# Setting Up Virtual Environment in VS Code

To work with a virtual environment in VS Code, follow these 

1. **Open the Folder in VS Code**
   - Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Open the terminal in VS Code.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Ensure you are in the activated virtual environment.
   - Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

By following these steps, you'll have a virtual environment set up in VS Code with the necessary libraries installed.
